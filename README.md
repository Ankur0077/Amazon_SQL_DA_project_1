# **Amazon USA Sales Analysis Project**

### **Difficulty Level: Advanced**

---

## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

## **Database Setup & Design**

### **Schema Structure**

```sql
Create Table category (
category_id Int Primary Key,
category_name Varchar(25)
);

-- Customers Table
Create Table customers(
Customer_ID	Int Primary key,
first_name	varchar(25),
last_name varchar(25),	
state varchar(25),
address varchar(20) Default ('xxxx') 
);

-- Inventory Table
Create Table inventory(
inventory_id Int primary key,
product_id int,
stock int,	
warehouse_id int,
last_stock_date Date,
CONSTRAINT products_fk_inventory FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);

-- order_items table
Create Table order_items(
order_item_id	Int Primary key,
order_id int,  -- FK
product_id int,	 -- FK
quantity int,
price_per_unit Double,
CONSTRAINT orders_fk_order_items FOREIGN KEY(order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),
CONSTRAINT products_fk_order_items FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)

);

-- orders table
Create table orders (
order_id int Primary key,
order_date Date,
customer_id int, -- FK
CONSTRAINT customer_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customers(Customer_id) ,
seller_id int, -- FK
CONSTRAINT sellers_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY(seller_id) REFERENCES sellers(seller_id),
order_status Varchar(20));

-- payments table
Create Table payments (
payment_id	int Primary key,
order_id int,
payment_date	Date,
payment_status Varchar(25),
CONSTRAINT orders_fk_payments FOREIGN KEY(order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id));

-- products table
Create table products(
product_id int Primary Key,
product_name varchar(50),
price double,
cogs double,
category_id int , -- Foreign key
CONSTRAINT product_fk_category FOREIGN KEY(category_id) References category(category_id) );

-- sellers table
Create table sellers(
seller_id int Primary Key,
seller_name Varchar(20),
origin varchar(20));

-- shipping table
Create table shipping(
shipping_id	 int primary key,
order_id int,
shipping_date Date,
return_date Date,
shipping_providers varchar(20),
delivery_status varchar(20),
CONSTRAINT orders_fk_shipping FOREIGN KEY(order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);

```

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by:
- **Removing duplicates**: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- **Handling missing values**: Null values in critical fields (e.g., customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

---

## **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled based on their context:
- **Customer addresses**: Missing addresses were assigned default placeholder values.
- **Payment statuses**: Orders with null payment statuses were categorized as “Pending.”
- **Shipping information**: Null return dates were left as is, as not all shipments are returned.

---

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- product performance
  

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking.
2. High return rates for specific product categories.
3. Significant delays in shipments and inconsistencies in delivery times.
4. High customer acquisition costs with a low customer retention rate.
